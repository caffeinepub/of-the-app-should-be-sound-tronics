  "summary": "REQ-7 and REQ-8 appear to be implemented: the catalog now lists the three requested products (with correct names/spelling), the Add to Cart flow supports adding/removing/updating quantities for those products, and missing prices are handled with an explicit \"Price unavailable\" message and totals that avoid NaN/undefined.",

      "description": "Introduced a new cart UI drawer/sheet with quantity controls, clear-cart, and an item-count badge in the header (potentially replacing/duplicating an existing cart UI/flow rather than only ensuring it works for new products).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest asks to ensure the existing Add to Cart flow works for newly listed products; the diff adds substantial new cart infrastructure (new CartSheet component, new Zustand cart store, and header integration). The diff summary does not show edits to an existing cart implementation, so this may be additional functionality beyond the request.",
