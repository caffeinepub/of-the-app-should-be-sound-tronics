# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the product showcase/catalog to include three new products and ensure they work with the existing cart flow.

**Planned changes:**
- Add/define catalog entries for “Cable marking stickers”, “XLR cables”, and “Used musical instruments” in the product showcase UI.
- Ensure the existing Add to Cart/remove-from-cart interactions work for the three new products.
- Handle missing/unconfigured product prices by showing a clear “price unavailable” message and preventing broken cart totals or crashes.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can see the three new products in the catalog on mobile and desktop, add/remove them in the cart, and if any item has no price the site clearly indicates the price is unavailable without breaking the cart.
